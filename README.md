# ROMST

In order to learn Rust I started this project. I have several emulators with MAME using a special place among all of them. One of the most tedious tasks is the Rom management. There are several tools such as ClrMamePro, Romcenter or Romulus, but all of them are Windows only (or cross platform using Wine). I wanted something fast to use, from the command line (maybe a UI in the future?) and cross-platofrm, and since I was elarning Rust, this seemed a cool project.

It is still a work in progress, I'll fill the documentation as I add features.
